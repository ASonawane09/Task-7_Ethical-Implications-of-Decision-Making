# Syracuse MBB 2023–24 — Stakeholder Decision Report
**Audience:** Head Coach & Staff | **Author:** Aakanksha Sonawane | **Date:** September 30, 2025

## 1) Purpose (One Line)
Convert Phase 2 analytics into **concrete practice and rotation adjustments** that can add **1–2 wins** with *low operational risk*.

## 2) Executive Summary
- **Primary levers:** (1) One-and-done defense (defensive rebounding discipline), (2) Turnover margin via structured press‑break roles, (3) Shot allocation to high‑efficiency shooters.  
- **Why now:** Changes are **operational**, require **no roster moves**, and align with observed 2023–24 tendencies.  
- **Risk:** Low—tactical tweaks, short install time (1–2 practices), measurable with simple KPIs.  
- **KPIs to track weekly:** Opp OREB% < 25%; Team TO% < 15%; +2 clean catch‑and‑shoot 3PA per half to elite shooters.

## 3) Background & Decision
- Source analysis: Phase 2 extended reasoning on Syracuse MBB 2023–24 (box‑score level).  
- Decision in scope: Which **practice priorities** and **late‑game scripts** most efficiently improve win probability?  

## 4) Data & Methods (Brief)
- Dataset: team box-score totals by player (points, rebounds, assists, steals, blocks, shooting splits).  
- Methods: descriptive profiling, role inference, and scenario reasoning; validated with spot checks and reproducible prompts.  
- Limits: no play‑by‑play, shot location, lineup on/off; opponent context limited. Conclusions emphasize **low-regret actions**.

## 5) Findings (Condensed)
1. **Defensive Rebounding Anchor** — *Maliq Brown* led team glass & stocks; formalize him as **primary anchor** with wings crack‑back rules.  
2. **Turnover Control Without Slowing Pace** — In pressure, **Copeland** designated middle flash; **Mintz** becomes release; **Starling** stretches opposite sideline.  
3. **Shot Diet Upgrade** — Script **2 extra Bell threes per half** (pindown→DHO, flare re‑screen). Assign **Starling** as lift target on Mintz drives.  
4. **Clutch Package** — **Empty‑side PnR (Mintz–Brown)** with **Spain PnR** counter to free roll or corner 3.  
5. **Foul Management** — Early verticality reminder for Brown; micro‑sub near TV timeout after first foul; use situational size minutes.

## 6) Recommendations (Tiered)
**Tier 1 — Low Risk, Immediate (practice this week)**
- Install crack‑back/box‑out rules for wings on shots from their side.  
- Hard‑code press‑break roles; run 5‑minute segment daily.  
- Add two Bell 3PA scripts per half; early‑offense drag → weak‑side Hammer call.  
- Track three KPIs on the bench whiteboard each game.

**Tier 2 — Moderate Risk, Pilot**
- Spain PnR as late‑game counter; pre‑assign reads for Mintz on nail help.  
- Short‑roll read for Brown: **opposite corner first**, then dunker.  
- Two‑week A/B of end‑game packages: Hammer vs Spain; compare points per ATO.

**Tier 3 — Strategic, Requires More Data**
- Lineup‑level efficiency tracking and shot‑location expected value modeling.  
- Opponent‑specific scouting integration for matchup‑driven scripts.

## 7) Risks, Ethics & Reliability (Overview)
- **Data limits** can skew conclusions—mitigated by focusing on low‑regret changes and explicit KPIs.  
- **Fairness**: ensure shot reallocation doesn’t create unintended role displacement; communicate rationale.  
- **Reliability**: weekly KPI review; pause/iterate if benchmarks not met.

## 8) Next Steps & Validation
- Begin Tier‑1 install immediately; review KPIs after **two games**.  
- Log drills and A/B results; escalate to Tier‑2 if metrics improve.  
- Collect lineup and shot‑location data for offseason validation study.
