# Ethics, Reliability & Risk Analysis

## Data & Model Limitations
- Box-score only; no play-by-play, shot locations, or lineup on/off.  
- LLM outputs can hallucinate—controlled via prompt discipline and validation.

## Fairness & Role Equity
- Shot reallocation is justified by efficiency; communicate role logic to players to avoid morale issues.  
- Monitor minutes/usage changes; ensure development opportunities remain.

## Reliability & Uncertainty
- Use weekly KPIs and small pilots (A/B of ATOs) to validate impact before full adoption.  
- Track variance and regression to mean across 3–5 games before concluding.

## Governance
- Document prompts and changes; archive in repo.  
- Use reproducible scripts and time-stamped logs.
